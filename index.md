## Tianqing Zhu (Simplified Chinese:祝天擎, Wu pin: Tsoq-thie-jin)

I am a student at Tsinghua University (YMSC), Beijing, China (PRC). My supervisor is professor [Si Li](https://sili-math.github.io/)

My research is in the representation theory, noncommutative geometry and mathematical structure of quantum field theory. I am now interested in the symplectic duality and the connection between the geometry of the symplectic resolution and the representation theory of the quantum group, especially the Nakajima variety and the categorification. I am also interested in the representation theory of the chiral algebra, factorization homology, quantum integrable model, BV quantization and the formality in the various Hochschild (co)homology.
